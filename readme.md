# Apple Homepage from 2014!

## Overview

The project suggestion was to "clone the website of the most design-forward companies in the world"... albeit circa 2014! [This](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/) is what it looked like.  The Odin Project was emphasizing working with background photos as well as gradients, but I felt that there wasn't too much that I would learn by doing this project as-is, so I chose to utilize Tailwind CSS to get some more practice with that.  Nevertheless I got kind of bored and left the webpage incomplete, at 99%.  But it's almost there!  The 1% that is still pending is mostly a responsive design for smaller screen sizes.  Check it out!

## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
  - I made some custom styles as well
- Semantic HTML
- Webfonts


### What I learned

This was more of an exercise than a true learning experience, but that's okay.  I got experience working with background images and gradients, as per the project's original intention, and I experimented with using more "old-school" layout methods such as centering with "margin: 0 auto" and "position: inline-block" (well, the Tailwind CSS equivalents), comparing it with the ease-of-use of Flexbox.  Building a page (and paying attention to detail) is like going to the gym.  It makes you a stronger coder.
